This repo has the slide decks for presentations I have presented at conferences. If the presentation is for a technical topic with some code you will find that deck in the repo with the code.

## Power Platform for the IT Professional
This presentation is an attempt to give a high level overview of the Power Platfrom and Dynamics 365. Each of the topics covered could be several sessions in and of themselves but we keep it high level. 

This presentation has three goals
- Introduce the Power Platform for the MSP.
- Provide a view of the depth and breadth of what is available.
- Give the MSP the knowledge to have a conversation with thier customer.

I want to give the MSP the tools to deepen their relationship with their customer.
